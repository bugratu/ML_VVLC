## ML Based V-VLC Channel Models Path Loss Prediction Application 

This application predicts V-VLC channel path loss by using the loaded pre-trained ML model and channel inputs. 
Execution steps; 

1- Load pre-trained model(i.e. RBFmodel.mat),

2- Load channel input data-set (i.e. RBFinputs.mat),

3- Plot predicted path loss with respect to distance,

4- Export predicted path loss (in dB) for the corresponding model and input variables.
