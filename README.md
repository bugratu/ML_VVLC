# Machine Learning Based Channel Modeling for Vehicular Visible Light Communication (V-VLC)

This repository provides measurement dataset to train and evaluate Machine Learning based Vehicular Visible Light Communication Channel models together with executable applications to predict path loss and channel frequency response of Vehicular Visible Light Communication. 

The V-VLC path loss model incorporates, ambient light, occupied lane, receiver inclination angle, inter-vehicle distance and optical turbulence channel model inputs.\
The V-VLC channel frequency response model incorporates, ambient light, receiver inclination angle, LED model and inter-vehicle distance.
